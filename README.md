# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
I wrote Steve code to analyze various workshets of stock data based on year at the click of a button. The stock ran well with the 12 tickers for 2017 and 2018, with about 3012 rows of data to loop through. The code consisted of a nested for loop. This required the macro to run through each of the 3012 rows 12 times to collect the data that Steve needed. 

I wanted to investigate if the code could be designed to run faster if we were to increase the number of tickers down the line. This project was designed to compare the efficiency of different VBA logic for Steve's analysis.
